# DS3_UnsupervisedLearning

This repository contains the unsupervised learning assigment using the "primates-morphology.csv" file. This datasetÂ contains coordinates from markers of skull features from different primate species. Utilizing unsupervised learning techniques, these will be clustered into groups by species.

## Required libraries
 Please update/install the following libraries:
* pandas 1.3.4
* numpy 1.20.3
* seaborn 0.11.2
* matplotlib 3.4.3
* plotly 5.5.0
* scipy 1.7.1
* sklearn 1.0.1
* yellowbrick 1.4

## Usage

Please open the FinalAssignment_UnsupervisedLearning_easy.ipynb using jupyter notebook, go to "Kernel" > "Restart and run all.
In the notebook there is the documented path on how the data was cleaned, how clustering was done and with what techniques.
